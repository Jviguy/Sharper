# Sharper
My newest Discord bot in C#
## HOW TO HOST
My discord bot runs off of program variables soooo <br>
u must build this with dotnet build tools <br >
Then U have to enter in the cmd like this <br >
dotnet path/to/built/dll/SharperBot.dll TOKENHERE GOOGLEAPITOKENHERE //this works because of how the program args are put into the original call so i used that <br>
i added in some google apis so u now have to provide a Google Custom Search api token and a Google Youtube data v3 api token (The custom search Cx is provided by me)
